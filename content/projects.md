### `p5.js ascii renderer`

this project is a simple brightness based ascii renderer using `p5.js` and a `GLSL` shader for rendering the ascii characters. it's open source and available at the link above.

it was abstracted from my more complex ascii rendering pipeline for others to use and learn from. in the beginning of my ascii rendering journey, i was completely relying on the CPU and low frame rates, wishing for a resource like this. i hope this project can help others to kickstart their own ascii rendering projects without having to worry about frame rates in regards to the ascii rendering itself anymore.

the project also features tons of features and customizability, accessible through an extensive `Tweakpane` overlay. if you are interested in writing a p5.js overlay to control parameters of your projects during run-time, record your canvas using `p5.Capture`, this project might be worth a look.

the demo can be found here: [`https://editor.p5js.org/humanbydefinition/full/ibclfMqlk`](https://editor.p5js.org/humanbydefinition/full/ibclfMqlk)

### [`p5.js ascii playground`](/playground/)

**note:** not mobile-friendly *yet* 

this tool features a more complex ascii rendering pipeline, featuring a set of customizable simulations to play around with. besides that, it features multiple pre shader effects to apply to the set simulations running in the `p5.js` sketch, creating fun and interesting visuals. it also features a multitude of gradient shaders, whose randomness can be controlled through the `Tweakpane` overlay, adding to the visual complexity of the rendered ascii art.

i am currently actively working on this tool and plan to include more simulations and effects in the future. feel free to reach out to me if you have any suggestions or ideas for this project.

the tool can be found here: [`/playground`](/playground/)

if you create and share something cool with this tool, i'd love to see and interact with it! ❤️ feel free to tag me on instagram [@humanbydefinition](https://www.instagram.com/humanbydefinition/) or reach out to me via other social media or via e-mail.

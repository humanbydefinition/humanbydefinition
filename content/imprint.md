### Disclaimer of liability
#### Liability for content
The contents of my pages have been created with the greatest care. However, I cannot assume any liability for the correctness, completeness and topicality of the contents. As a service provider, I am responsible for my own content on these pages in accordance with § 7 para.1 TMG (German Telemedia Act) and general laws. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, however, I am not obliged as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information in accordance with general legislation remain unaffected by this. However, liability in this respect is only possible from the time of knowledge of a specific infringement. As soon as I become aware of such infringements, I will remove this content immediately.

#### Liability for links
My websites contain links to external third-party websites over whose content I have no influence. I can therefore accept no liability for this third-party content. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not recognisable at the time of linking. However, permanent monitoring of the content of the linked pages is not possible without concrete evidence. 

#### Copyright and labelling law
The author endeavours to observe the copyrights of the images, graphics, sound documents, video sequences and texts used in all publications, to use images, graphics, sound documents, video sequences and texts created by himself or to make use of licence-free graphics, sound documents, video sequences and texts.
All brands and trademarks mentioned on the website and possibly protected by third parties are subject without restriction to the provisions of the applicable trademark law and the ownership rights of the respective registered owners. The mere mention of a trade mark does not imply that it is not protected by third-party rights!
The copyright for published objects created by the author himself remains solely with the author of the pages. Any duplication or use of objects such as diagrams, sounds or texts in other electronic or printed publications is not permitted without the author's agreement.

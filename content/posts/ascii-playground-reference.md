## general information
the [`ascii playground`](/playground/) is a tool that allows you to create ascii art in your browser utilizing [`p5.js`](https://p5js.org/) and [`GLSL`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/3D_on_the_web/GLSL_Shaders) shaders. it features a wide variety of simulations, effect shaders and gradient shaders to play around with. the ascii shader is the final step in the process, where the colors of the gradient buffer are translated to the unique ascii characters that exist in the defined character sets. the ascii output is highly customizable, allowing you to adjust the font, font size, color mode, color, grid size and more. the tool is designed to be flexible and customizable, so you can create a wide variety of ascii art styles. 

the tool is accessible through an extensive [`Tweakpane`](https://tweakpane.github.io/docs/) overlay, which allows you to control and customize the parameters of the tool during run-time. the tool also features the ability to record your canvas using [`p5.Capture`](https://github.com/tapioca24/p5.capture), so you can save your creations as videos or images.

**note**: as of now, the tool is not mobile-friendly *yet*, but it might be in the future.

## basic features

- track and limit the frame rate to your liking
- reset the whole sketch and its components to its initial state `frameCount = 1` with a given random seed for reproducibility
- define the maximum number of layers to create gradient shaders for
- export and import your progress as a json file
    - the exported file contains all settings, but not your uploaded files _(images, videos, fonts, ..)_
        - exception to this are the uploaded character sets and the uploaded color palettes, which are preserved in the exported file
- capture the current frame as an image (`.png` or `.jpg`)
- record the current sketch as a video (`.webm`, `.gif`, `.png` or `.jpg`)
    - the frame rate is currently statically set to 60 fps

## simulations
theoretically, an infinite number of simulations can be added to the ascii playground. all defined simulations share a common [`WEBGL`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/WEBGL) graphic buffer. the execution order is determined by the position of the simulations in the list. the simulation displayed at the top of the overlay is executed last, making it the topmost layer.

> {{< collapse summary="**shared settings**" >}}
the following settings are shared across all simulations:
- `remove` - remove the simulation from the list
- `move` - move the simulation up or down in the list
- `active` - toggle the simulation on or off
- `scale` - the scale of the simulation
- `rotation` - the rotation of the simulation
- `x` - the x position of the simulation _(based around the center of the simulation)_
- `y` - the y position of the simulation _(based around the center of the simulation)_
- `z` - the z position of the simulation _(based around the center of the simulation)_

### textureviewer
the textureviewer allows you to upload a fragment shader to the `p5.js` sketch, which is rendered onto a plane that fills the window.

> {{< collapse summary="**settings**" >}}
- `frag shader` - the fragment shader to be rendered onto the plane
    - the fragment shader being uploaded needs to be in a `.frag` format
    - `p5.js` only supports `GLSL ES 1.0`, so make sure your fragment shader is compatible with this version
> {{< /collapse >}}


> {{< collapse summary="**uniforms**" >}}
the following uniforms are available to the shader:
- `time` - `frameCount * 0.01` is passed to the shader
- `resolution` - the `windowWidth` and `windowHeight` are passed to the shader
- `seed` - a random value between 0 and 1 is passed to the shader. get a new random value by resetting the sketch.

    vec2 i1;
    i1 = (x0.x > x0.y) ? vec2(1.0, 0.0) : vec2(0.0, 1.0);
    vec4 x12 = x0.xyxy + C.xxzz;
    x12.xy -= i1;

    i = mod(i, 289.0);
    vec3 p = permute( permute( i.y + vec3(0.0, i1.y, 1.0 ))

    vec3 g;
    g.x  = a0.x  * x0.x  + h.x  * x0.y;
    g.yz = a0.yz * x12.xz + h.yz * x12.yw;
    return 130.0 * dot(m, g);
}

void main() {
    vec2 uv = gl_FragCoord.xy / resolution.xy;
    uv.y -= time; // Subtract time to the y coordinate to create upward movement
    float f = snoise(uv + seed);
    gl_FragColor = vec4(vec3(f), 1.0);

theoretically, an infinite number of pre effect shaders can be added to the ascii playground. all defined pre effect shaders are applied to the graphic buffer in sequence. the execution order is determined by the position of the pre effect shaders in the list. the pre effect shader displayed at the top of the overlay is executed last, making it the topmost layer.

## gradient shaders
the gradient shaders input is the graphic buffer, that contains the result from all defined pre effect shaders. this buffer is grayscaled before being passed to the gradient shaders. 

the result of the gradient shaders is saved in a separate buffer that is passed separately to the ascii shader, containing the colors that are translated to the unique ascii characters that exist in the defined character sets.

for the number of grayscale layers set in the overlay, a random gradient shader is created. the randomness can be adjusted by the user in certain ways. each randomly generated gradient shader is applied to a certain grayscale range, based on the number of max layers set in the overlay.

if `reset` is clicked on this tab, the whole sketch is reset to its initial state `frameCount = 1` with the current random seed for reproducibility.
